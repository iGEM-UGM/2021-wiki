  | Our main goal is to create a feasible on-off system of the cyanide production and degradation according to either the presence or absence of arabinose. This page displays three engineering cycles; i.e., cyanide production, cyanide degradation, and arabinose conversion. Afterwards, an engineering cycle about the Auviola on-off system is performed to associate the aforementioned three cycles. An engineering cycle about the bioreactor is also demonstrated as the implementation of our Auviola system.

            p
              | The HCN synthase, or also known as glycine dehydrogenase, is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of an amino acid glycine into cyanide.1 This enzyme is a heterotrimeric protein as encoded by a cluster of three genes called hcnABC operon. This enzyme belongs to the oxidoreductase class as it oxidizes the amine (CH-NH2) functional group into imine (C=NH) and consecutively cleaves the molecule into HCN and carbon dioxide (CO2).2

              | According to previous study, the gold leaching process requires HCN compounds with concentration of 600 mg/L.2 On the other hand, a wild-type of C. violaceum was previously studied to produce 0.71 - 16 micromoles/mL which nearly equals to 19 - 432 of HCN in 8 hours.3 Therefore, an optimization of produced HCN concentration should be conducted to achieve an effective gold leaching process.

              | How to create and design an arabinose regulated cyanide overproduction system?
            p
              | The principle in this system is induction of overproduction of cyanide in the presence of arabinose using pBAD-AraC regulation. We used E. coli DH5-&alpha;, E. coli BL21, and C. violaceum ATCC 12472 as the chassis&rsquo; to test the system. At this stage, we utilized several standard parts already used by previous iGEM teams listed below:
            ol
              li BBa_K808000 (AraC-pBAD)
              li BBa_B0015 (double terminator)
              li BBa_B0034m (strong RBS)
            p
              | We used AraC-pBAD from BBa_K808000 to regulate the hcnABC operon. We modified the hcnABC operon by adding RBS before each gene (hcnA, hcnB, hcnC) in the hcnABC operon and also double terminator B0015. The hcnB and hcnC genes have a high percentage of GC content so we faced some problems to synthesize it. Thus, we altered the hcnB gene sequence to reduce the GC content and to remove some illegal sites. We also altered some bases in hcnC gene to remove the illegal site. For a deeper understanding of the construction, you can visit the Auviola design page (linked to the design page). The recombinant plasmid transformed was verified through colony PCR and the part inserted was sequenced. To analyze the effect on cyanide produced, we used the picric acid method to determine the cyanide concentration. We also performed the growth rate measurement to know the effect of our plasmid expression on the cell growth.
            p
              | A kinetic modelling for demonstrating an overproduction of cyanide was performed using Tellurium&rsquo;s approach in Python language. This modelling used some parameters obtained from literature study. In addition, a genome scale modelling was performed to maximize cyanide production flux in the C. violaceum metabolic pathway.

              | After we went through the design phase, we started to conduct our project at the Biotechnology Laboratory of Inter University Center in Universitas Gadjah Mada. We ordered hcnA, hcnB, and hcnC sequences from Twist Bioscience. The sequences were referred to the genome of Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 (NCBI: GenBank: AE016825.1). In order to meet the BioBrick standard and synthesize requirement, we altered some of its sequences. The sequences have some alterations in hcnB and hcnC to reduce the GC content and remove the illegal sites. However,  Twist Bioscience reported a problem in synthesizing the hcnC gene, thus the hcnC synthesize failed. Thus, we isolated the hcnC gene using PCR from the genome of C. violaceum ATCC 12472 and removed an illegal site inside the sequence using overlap PCR (Phusion polymerase). The assembly of plasmid backbone (pSB1C3), AraC-pBAD (BBa_K808000), RBS (BBa_B0034m), hcnABC operon, and double terminator (BBa_B0015) were done using Gibson Assembly.

            p
              | Among several cyanide-degrading genes, the rhodanese is chosen to be the added gene whose regulation is not affected by the presence of glycine and methionine, unlike the others.12
