    | Mini Talkshow: Meet the iGEM Teams
  p On August 27#[sup th] and 28#[sup th], we held an online event entitled UGM Synbio Online Festival 2021. Being held for two days, the UGM Synbio Online Festival consisted of three sessions. Mini Talkshow: Meet the iGEM Teams was the last session of the UGM Synbio Online Festival. Special for this session, we invited 4 guest star iGEM teams from Universitas Indonesia, Universitas Brawijaya, Moscow city, and Korea_HS as a speaker.
  p In order to create an intimate discussion, we were introducing our team members and sharing our projects with each other. In addition, we gained various insights by sharing our problems and how to solve them. Our four guest stars were awesome in conducting their project. Their brilliant ideas and great aptitude were behind their swift and well-organized progress. These collaborations have led our team members to be more enthusiastic in working on our Auviola project. Our last event was amazing! Thank you for guesting on ours and see you at the medal ceremony!
